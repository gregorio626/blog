----When adding or editing a post, the name of the image gets stored, but the actual image does not get moved into the
    folder where all of the images are stored.
!---FIX: There are no permissions for the file to be moved to the images folder. so try running this command as root:
        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/blog/
